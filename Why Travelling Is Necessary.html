<h1>Why Is Travelling Necessary?</h1>
</center>

<p>
"Traveling is important in life because it will open you up to a new way of living and being. You will experience new connections with people and places and immerse in different cultures, which can help widen your perspective. So much learning and personal growth can come from traveling. 
</p>

<p>
"It can open us up to seeing another culture’s way of life and perspective and allow us to connect with different people and places. We can learn to live more fully in the present moment and increase our resilience.
</p>

<p>
1. Experience A Different Way Of Life And Shift Your Perspective.
When we travel to different locations, whether it be within our own country or overseas, there is so much to be explored and experienced by us. Any new place you visit will have a different feel to it, it may be a total contrast to what you are used to or it may have similarities. Nonetheless, this new place can be a teacher for you.
</p>

<p>
2. Learn To Live In The Present Moment And Be Resilient
When you are traveling, you give yourself permission to explore and experience places from a place of curiosity and wonder. You don’t dwell on the past or think too far ahead in the future. Instead, you are present with your now-moment experience.

Many people who go traveling overseas take time off work and perhaps take weeks, if not months, off from their normal day-to-day life.
